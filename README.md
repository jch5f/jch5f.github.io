I'm a physicist interrested in stochastic processes, applied category theory, and chaos. During my PhD I created new methods for straining two-dimensional materials by securing them to micro-electromechanical systems. While this proved daunting enough of a task, my interest in achieving such a feat was to explore strain generated pseudo-magnetic fields and the topological phase transitions such manipulations would induce. Since finishing my PhD I have been researching models to understand and predict how the physiology of congestive heart failure evolves. I have been humbled by the new perspective I must now take in understanding information, and I continually take what I've learned in this new setting and update my posterior about how I understand fundamental physics. I think its safe to say my thoughts are evolving according to some non-linear stochastic process, and that keeps it fun and exciting!
